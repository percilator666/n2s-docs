# ðŸš› Bobcat

When the Bobcat Event Starts, it will pop up in the top of your screen along with red truck, with a redzone around it on the map. The truck is constantly moving.

Go to the location on the map, and try to stop the vehicle. Please note that the surrounding area is a REDZONE. So there will be active shooting the entire time, trying to win over the truck. Once you get to the vehicle you must have a C4 Bomb on you. You must plant the C4 onto the truck in order to blow up the back doors.

Press E to plant the bomb and make sure to run away!

Once the truck is exploded, go towards the truck, Press E to the loot the truck.

If you get to the Bobcat Late, and the Truck is looted, you will get this notification.
