# üõ•Ô∏è Tugboat

Tugboat Event is an armed boat event, with multiple loot caches. You will get a notification in the sky, when the Event has started. TugBoat is a REDZONE

Once the boat has spawned, it will be pinged on the map.

Head to the tugboat, note you WILL need a **boat**. Make sure purchase one before heading the the area.

Once you get to the boat, you will have to kill the security that guards the boat. Please note if you die during tugboat, you will NOT be able to come back. You have ONE LIFE.

After you are done killing the bots, head to each loot cache and enjoy the loot you've won.
