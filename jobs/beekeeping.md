# üêù Beekeeping

Head to the **Beekeeper in Paleto Bay** ‚Äî his location is marked on your map.

When you interact with him, a **menu** will appear.

**Purchase Materials**

From the menu, you‚Äôll see a list of **beekeeping materials** available for purchase.

To get started, you‚Äôll need to buy:

* **1 Bee House**
* **1 Bee Hive**

Once purchased, head to **any location** of your choice to begin beekeeping.

**Beekeeping**

At your chosen spot, place down both the **Bee House** and the **Bee Hive**.

Each structure has a different purpose:

**Bee House**

Once placed, the **Bee House automatically begins collecting**:

* **Queen Bees**
* **Worker Bees**

Let it sit and accumulate bees over time.

**Bee Hive**

Once you‚Äôve collected at least:

* **1 Queen Bee**
* **5 Worker Bees**

You can place them into your **Bee Hive**.

**Honey and Wax Production**

Once the bees are added, your hive's **production status** will switch to **‚ÄúActive.‚Äù**

From there, your hive will slowly begin producing:

* **Wax**
* **Honey**

You can check back periodically to collect your goods.

**Sell Products**

Once you‚Äôve collected honey and wax, return to the **Beekeeper in Paleto Bay** to sell your products and earn your payout.
