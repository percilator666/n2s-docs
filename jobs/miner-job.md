# 🪨 Miner Job

**Receive Job**

Start at **City Hall (Postal 7220)**. Talk to **Jenna at the front desk**. Select: `[View City Jobs]` → **Miner Job**

Your current job will now display in the **top-right corner** of your screen and by typing `/jobs`.

Once you're hired, head to the **Miner job site**.

When you arrive at the job site, speak to the **Job Manager** to open the **Job Screen**.

**Job Screen Overview**

**Top Left Tabs**: `Job` | `Rank`

Switch to the **Rank tab** to purchase your first **mining tool**. _(Tip: Tools break fairly easily — it’s smart to buy a couple.)_

**Starting the Job**

1. Go back to the **Job** tab.
2. Select: `Start a New Job`
3. If you’re working with others, they can join under `Join a Group`.
4. When ready, click `Start Job`.

A **truck** will spawn behind you — hop in and drive to the **mining field**. **Mineable rocks** will be marked on your map.

**Mine Rocks**

At each rock:

* Press `[ALT]` (your **third eye key**) to start mining.
* A **minigame** will begin. Keep the **white line** inside the **green zone** by tapping — don’t let it reach the red!
* If the line hits the red and stays too long, **your tool breaks**.
* If successful, you’ll receive a **rock** and possibly **ore** in your inventory.

Go to the **back of your truck**, use `[ALT]`/third eye, and store the rocks.

Mine as many rocks as you’d like!

**Processing Materials**

Once you're done mining, head to the **processing stations**:

* **Claw icon** = Rock Processing
* **Two lightning bolts** = Ore Processing

**🪨 Rock Processing**

1. Get out of your truck.
2. Use `[ALT]`/third eye at the **trunk**, select: `Take Rocks`
3. Carry the rock to the **ledge**, then `[ALT]`/third eye → `Process Rock`

Processed rocks **won’t show in your inventory**, but they **count toward your job total**.

**⛏️ Ore Processing**

* At the ore station, press `[ALT]`/third eye and select the **ore** in your inventory.
* Input the amount you want to process and confirm.

Again, nothing will appear in your inventory — it will update in your **job screen totals**.

**Finish Job**

After processing:

* Open your **Job Screen** to see your final totals under **Job Statistics**
  * This includes how many **rocks and ores** you processed
  * And the **money** you’ll earn

Make sure your **truck is nearby**, then click `End Job`.

Your payment will go directly to your **bank account**.

**Leveling Up**

As you **rank up**, you’ll unlock **better tools** under the `Rank` tab — making mining faster and more efficient!
