#### What Constitutes Combat Logging <a href="#what-constitutes-combat-logging" id="what-constitutes-combat-logging"></a>

* **Intentional Disconnects:** Leaving the game (using F8, Alt+F4, or any other method) during an active roleplay scenario to avoid arrest, robbery, death, or any other consequence.
* **Unreported Crashes:** Failing to report a legitimate game crash that occurs during a scene. If your game crashes, you must immediately notify staff or provide proof if requested.
* **Internet Manipulation:** Deliberately disconnecting your internet or causing a network failure to escape a roleplay situation.
* **Avoiding Roleplay:** Leaving the server to avoid any form of roleplay, including police interactions, robberies, or ongoing scenes.

#### Examples of Combat Logging <a href="#examples-of-combat-logging" id="examples-of-combat-logging"></a>

* **F8‚Äôing during a police scene** to avoid arrest or questioning.
* **F8‚Äôing to avoid getting robbed** or losing your items.
* **F8‚Äôing to avoid any RP** that you do not want to participate in.
* **Pulling out your internet cord** or otherwise disconnecting your internet to escape a situation.

#### Additional <a href="#additional" id="additional"></a>

* **Reporting Crashes:** If your game crashes mid-scene, you must report it to staff or the involved parties as soon as possible. Be prepared to provide proof (such as a screenshot or video) if requested.
* **AFK Protocol:** If you need to go AFK, you must go to a green zone (safe zone) first. Do not leave your character unattended in active roleplay areas.
* **Rejoin When Possible:** If disconnected unintentionally, rejoin the server and resume the roleplay as soon as possible.
