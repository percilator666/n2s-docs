#### Hostile Encounters & KOS <a href="#hostile-encounters-and-kos" id="hostile-encounters-and-kos"></a>

* **KOS Timer:** Once a gang initiates on another gang at a drug location, there is a **10-minute KOS (Kill On Sight) timer** at that specific location for the gangs involved in that shootout.
* **No Alliances for Holding:** **No alliances are allowed to hold down drug locations together.** Only one gang may control a location at a time.
* **Alliance Restrictions:** If your allied gang is present at the drug location you are holding and your gang gets into a gunfight, **your alliance is prohibited from engaging in the shootout**. They may only initiate after the 10-minute KOS period ends.

#### Takeover & Numbers <a href="#takeover-and-numbers" id="takeover-and-numbers"></a>

* **Outnumbering Rule:** To take over a drug location, your gang must **outnumber the individuals inside at a 3:1 ratio**.
  * **Example:** If there are 3 members of another gang inside, you need 9 members of your own gang to push them out. If there is only 1 civilian, you need at least 3 members of your gang.

#### Special Situations <a href="#special-situations" id="special-situations"></a>

* **Police Raids:** If PD initiates a raid at any drug location, **gangs may team up to fight/counter PD**. This is the only exception to the no-alliance rule for holding down locations.
