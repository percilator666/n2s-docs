# üë∫ Fail RP

#### What Constitutes Fail RP <a href="#what-constitutes-fail-rp" id="what-constitutes-fail-rp"></a>

* **Unrealistic Actions:** Performing actions that would not be possible or believable in real life or within the game‚Äôs roleplay environment.
* **Ignoring Roleplay Consequences:** Failing to react appropriately to dangerous or life-threatening situations.
* **Breaking Immersion:** Doing things that disrupt the roleplay experience for others or break the immersion of the scenario.

#### Examples of Fail RP <a href="#examples-of-fail-rp" id="examples-of-fail-rp"></a>

* **Ignoring Threats:** Not putting your hands up or failing to comply when you have guns pointed at you.
* **Talking While Dead:** Communicating after your character has died, especially if you have been ‚Äúdouble tapped‚Äù (a player stands over you and shoots you in the head twice).
* **Unrealistic Vehicle Use:** Carrying 3-4 friends stacked on a single motorcycle.
* **Exploiting Emotes:** Using emotes to glitch through walls or into secured areas that should not be accessible.
* **Hot Repairing:** Repairing your vehicle instantly or unrealistically (e.g., ‚Äúhot repairing‚Äù) during an active chase or combat situation.
* **Unrealistic Escapes:** Performing stunts or maneuvers that are not possible for your character or vehicle, such as jumping from extreme heights and surviving without injury.

#### Additional <a href="#additional" id="additional"></a>

* **Stay in Character:** Always act as your character would in real life, given the circumstances.
* **Respect the Scene:** Do not do anything that would break the immersion or realism of the ongoing roleplay.
* **No Exploiting:** Do not use glitches, bugs, or exploits to perform actions that would otherwise be impossible.
