# üëø Gang Rules

#### General Rules <a href="#general-rules" id="general-rules"></a>

* **Responsibility:** If you‚Äôre a gang owner or leader, you are responsible for relaying all gang rules to your members.
* **No Selling/Transferring Gangs:** When purchasing a gang from TMFRP, you are **not allowed to sell or transfer ownership**. If caught, you will be banned and your gang will be disbanded and/or blacklisted.
* **Cheating Consequences:** If the gang leader is banned for cheating, your gang is subject to being disbanded and/or blacklisted.
  * If a gang member is banned for cheating, the gang will receive 2 strikes. The player in question is also required to purchase a cheater unban, and must factory reset (with proof). Players who get banned twice for cheating will be **blacklisted from the server.**
* **PC Checks:** Gang leaders are responsible for ensuring that all gang members are PC checked if required.
* **No Chain Robbing (GANGS):** Once you rob someone, you are put on a 1 hour cooldown for robbing the same gang before you can rob another individual within that gang. Chain robbing is not allowed.
* **Gang/Player Reports:** Reports must be made at the time of incident. Holding onto clips for the purpose of using them against players later will deem the clip invalid - clips must be clear, visible, and provide full context. Include proof of players/ID/discord and f10.
  * When reporting a player, you must provide _at least_ 3 clips from the same player for your player report to be valid.
* **Gang Cooldown:** When leaving a gang, players must wait 3 days before joining a new gang (you may donate to lift this cooldown).
* **Strikes:** If a gang only has 1 strike and does not get a 2nd strike within 30 days, we will wipe the 1st strike.
  * If a gang waits until 3 strikes to pay them off, they are required to pay a gang disbandment fee.
* When leaving a gang, gang members will be placed on a **3 day cooldown.** They may not get new gang roles until they cooldown ends, or unless they purchase the CD off.
* You must have props on at all times, not doing may result in a gang strike and/or comms

#### Whitelisted Clothing Rules <a href="#whitelisted-clothing-rules" id="whitelisted-clothing-rules"></a>
