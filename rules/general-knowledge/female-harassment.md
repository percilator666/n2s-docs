# ♀️ Female Harassment

**General**

* All players must treat each other with respect and courtesy. Harassment, discrimination, and offensive behavior-including sexism and gender-based hate speech-will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
* The server is a safe and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of gender. Any attempt to make others uncomfortable or unsafe will be met with disciplinary action.

**Prohibited Behaviors**

* Any form of harassment, including but not limited to sexist comments, unwanted sexual advances, threats, doxing, or cyberstalking, is strictly forbidden.
* Use of gender-based slurs, derogatory language, or offensive jokes targeting women will result in immediate consequences, up to and including permanent bans.
* Unwanted sexual or romantic messages, in-game or via direct messages, are not allowed.
* Non-consensual sexual roleplay or any form of sexual harassment is strictly prohibited and will result in a permanent ban.
* Repeatedly targeting, griefing, or trolling female players, either in-character or out-of-character, is considered harassment and will not be tolerated.

**Consent and Roleplay Boundaries**

* All NSFW or erotic roleplay must be consensual and agreed upon by all involved parties. Non-consensual acts or harassment of any kind are strictly forbidden.
* If a player indicates discomfort or asks for a specific behavior to stop (either in-character or OOC), you must immediately cease that behavior. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action.
* Any form of sexual roleplay, including implied or explicit acts, must be conducted only with prior consent and in appropriate, private channels if permitted by server rules.

* Players are encouraged to report any incidents of harassment or inappropriate behavior to server staff or moderators immediately.
* Attempts to find loopholes or skirt around these rules will be treated as violations and may result in punishment at the discretion of the staff.
