# ðŸ“œ Player Reports Policy

### **Report Submissions:** <a href="#report-submissions" id="report-submissions"></a>

Reports can be made in-city, as well as creating a ticket within the N2SRP Discord Server. Every report made must have evidence to support the claim being made. **Clips must be 1-2 minute long and include audio**. Failing to do so will render the report **invalid** until further evidence is provided. **Clips must be reported within 24 hours or they will be deemed invalid**.

If you are rule breaking within your clip, trying to report another party, your clip then becomes invalid. **No Revenge Reporting.** Only submit reports for violations specified on this page. Submitting tickets for non-rule breaks or things you believe are rule breaks will result in an immediate denial of your report and it will be closed instantly. **In-city Reporting:** /report _(report command in-city)_ **Discord Reporting: #**&#x73;upport-tickets **Ban Appeals:** You can create a ticket within the #support-tickets section in the discord. If you have clip watch role, and you get 2-3 + kills you need to clip the whole fight.

**Note:** If a gang member is banned for cheating, the gang will receive 2 strikes. The player in question is also required to purchase a cheater unban, and must factory reset (with proof). Cheaters will also get a 'MUST STREAM' role in N2SRP and must clip with approved software for **all gameplay sessions.** Players who get banned twice for cheating will be **blacklisted from the server.** When asking for a player's pov in a KOTH, redzone (i.e opium), or gang fight, you must ask in city and specify player's server ID.

All clips from cheater reports must be _at least_ 30 seconds long from both sides.

If you are unable to provide your pov when asked, you will be conserved. The severity of the punishment will increase if the player is continuously unable to post.
