#### What Constitutes Metagaming <a href="#what-constitutes-metagaming" id="what-constitutes-metagaming"></a>

**External Streams:** You cannot watch or listen to any live streams (Discord, YouTube, Twitch, etc.) that may provide you with in-game information while you are actively playing.

**Out-of-Character Knowledge:** You may not use any information your character would not realistically know, including details learned from OOC chat, forums, streams, or other players outside of the game, to influence your in-game actions.

#### Examples of Metagaming <a href="#examples-of-metagaming" id="examples-of-metagaming"></a>

* **Watching a friendâ€™s stream to find out where other players are or what they are doing, then using that information in your own gameplay.**
* **Receiving or giving tips, warnings, or updates about in-game events through text messages, phone calls, or any means outside of the gameâ€™s built-in communication systems.**

#### Additional <a href="#additional" id="additional"></a>

* **Stay In-Character:** All communication and decision-making should be based solely on what your character knows and experiences in-game.
* **No Ghosting:** Do not use information from spectating, streams, or other outside sources to influence your gameplay.
* **Report Metagaming:** If you suspect metagaming, report it to server staff with evidence. Do not take matters into your own hands.
