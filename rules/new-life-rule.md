# ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π New Life Rule

#### What the New Life Rule Means <a href="#what-the-new-life-rule-means" id="what-the-new-life-rule-means"></a>

**Memory Loss:** After death, your character forgets all details, events, and people involved in the situation that led to your death. You cannot seek revenge, share information, or act on anything related to your previous life.

**No Return:** You are not allowed to return to the location of your death for at least 15 minutes, even if the scenario is ongoing or your friends are still involved.

**No Revenge:** You may not use any information from the events that led to your death to retaliate, inform others, or influence future roleplay.

**Double Tap Rule:** If you are "double tapped" (someone stands over you and shoots you in the head twice), you forget everything leading up to your death, even if EMS revives you.

#### Examples of New Life Rule: <a href="#examples-of-new-life-rule" id="examples-of-new-life-rule"></a>

* **Returning to the Scene:** Going back to the place where you died before the 15-minute timer is up.
* **Remembering Events:** Using knowledge from before your death to influence your actions, such as identifying or seeking out your killers.
* **Revenge Kill:** Tracking down and attacking those responsible for your previous death.
* **Double Tap Scenario:** If you are executed (double tapped), you cannot remember anything from the incident, regardless of EMS revival.

#### Additional <a href="#additional" id="additional"></a>

* **EMS Revive:** If you are revived by EMS and were not double tapped, you may roleplay minor memory loss or confusion, but you still cannot remember specific details or identities from the events that led to your death.
* **Communication:** Do not relay information from your previous life to other players, in or out of character.
* **Roleplay Integrity:** Respect the New Life Rule to ensure fair and immersive roleplay for everyone on the server.
