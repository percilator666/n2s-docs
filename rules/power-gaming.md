* **Ignoring Realism:** Taking actions that your character could not realistically perform, or neglecting logical consequences for your actions.

* **Initiating in Bulletproof Vehicles:** Attempting to start or escalate a hostile situation while inside a bulletproof or otherwise unrealistic vehicle.
* **Exploiting:** Using any kind of exploit, glitch, or unintended game mechanic to gain an advantage (e.g., bug abuse, item duplication).
* **Emote Cancelling:** Cancelling emotes to avoid being restrained, injured, or to gain an unfair advantage in combat.
* **TMF Roll & Spamming X:** Using TMF Roll, spamming the "X" key while shooting, or any similar actions to dodge bullets or gain an unrealistic edge in combat.
