# ðŸ’· Robbing & Scamming

#### Robbing Rules <a href="#robbing-rules" id="robbing-rules"></a>

* **No Killing After Robbery:** You may not kill someone after robbing them. The purpose of robbery is theft, not murder.
* **No Robbing During Shootouts:** You may not rob someone in the middle of a shootout or active gunfight.
* **Protected Roles:** You may not rob EMS, lawyers, judges, or any police personnel at any time.
* **No Chain Robbing:** Once you rob someone, you are put on a 30-minute cooldown before robbing another individual. Chain robbing is not allowed. (SEE GANG TAB FOR INFORMATION REGARDING GANGS)
* **Business Employees:** You may not rob on-duty employees at businesses. Employees must be wearing business attire to be protected; if someone is wearing gang attire while clocked in, they can be robbed.
* **Robbery Ratio:** All robbing encounters must be a 3-to-1 ratio (robbers to victim). You cannot rob someone if you do not have at least three robbers present.
* **No Forced Withdrawals:** You cannot make someone pull money from their bank account or use in-game banking features during a robbery.
* **Robbing PD:** PD is only robbable of illegal contraband! **DO NOT TAKE: Med Kits, Ammo, PD items/weapons, or donuts. You cannot steal PD vehicles either. Robbable items: Contraband taken off you, illegal guns, gun store guns, drugs, blueprints, dirty and clean cash, bank items (drills, drill bits, thermite) and raw materials. PD are not loot bags, they are the main RP of the city and this rule is in place to keep them in city and able to do their job. With more PD comes better roleplay and more chances to hit banks!**
* **Robbing EMS: YOU CANNOT ROB EMS OR STEAL THEIR CARS. Also, CANNOT kill them.**
