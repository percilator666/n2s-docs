#### Initiation Guidelines <a href="#initiation-guidelines" id="initiation-guidelines"></a>

* **You must initiate for at least 60 seconds before robbing someone.**
* Civilians should **NOT** be targeted by gang members unless the civilian initiates the interaction.
  * This includes
    * Civilian Players that do no crime.
    * Criminals - Players that are not in a gang, but engage in criminal activity.
    * Gang Members - Criminal Involved in a gang.
* **Verbal or Physical Cues:** Initiation can be done through clear verbal threats, commands, or obvious physical actions (such as aiming a weapon).
* **No Silent Aggression:** Do not attack, rob, or steal from another player without proper initiation. Surprise attacks without clear intent are considered FailRP.
* **Time to React:** Always give the other player reasonable time to react or comply after initiating.

#### Examples of Initiation <a href="#examples-of-initiation" id="examples-of-initiation"></a>

* **Aiming is Initiation:** Pointing a weapon at someone is considered initiation and signals your hostile intent.
* **Robbing Trunks:** Attempting to rob the trunk of someone‚Äôs vehicle is an act of initiation.
* **Taking or Driving Away with Someone Else‚Äôs Car:** Entering, stealing, or driving away in another player‚Äôs vehicle is considered initiation and may lead to further hostile actions.
* **Verbal Threats:** Clearly stating your demands or intentions (e.g., ‚ÄúPut your hands up or I‚Äôll shoot!‚Äù) is a valid form of initiation.
* **Examples of Civlian - Gang Interaction**
  * A gang member is in the coke lab with 3 other gang members & they interact with another player farming coke, leading to a robbery. This situation is OKAY because farming drugs is a criminal activity.
  * A civilian is putting gas in their car next to a group of gang members. The gang members interact with the civilian, leading to a robbery. This situation is NOT okay because the civilian is not provoking them leading up to being robbed.

* **No Random Attacks:** Do not initiate hostile actions without a valid reason or roleplay context.
* **No Ambushes Without Initiation:** Even in ambushes, you must make your intentions clear before engaging.
