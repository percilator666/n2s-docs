# ðŸ’ž Value Life

You must always roleplay fear for your characterâ€™s life when faced with threats of serious harm or death. This means acting realistically in dangerous situations, such as when someone has a weapon pointed at you or you are outnumbered.

Do not act recklessly or unrealistically when your characterâ€™s life is clearly at risk. For example, do not attempt to fight back or run if you are surrounded and unarmed, or if compliance is the only reasonable option.

If you are being held at gunpoint, taken hostage, or otherwise placed in a life-threatening scenario, your character must prioritize survival and act accordingly (e.g., comply with demands, avoid escalating the situation).

Bystanders and civilians must also show realistic fear for their lives during violent or criminal events, attempting to flee or avoid danger rather than intervening unless escape is impossible.

Do not use out-of-character knowledge or game mechanics to escape life-threatening situations unrealistically (e.g., combat logging, exploiting safe zones, or respawning to avoid consequences).

Breaking FearRP or failing to value your characterâ€™s life may result in disciplinary action, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent bans depending on the severity of the offense.

**Examples of Rule Breaches**

* Charging armed individuals without a weapon or backup.
* Refusing to comply with armed robbersâ€™ demands when you are at a clear disadvantage.
* Returning to a scene of your own death (violates New Life Rule as well).
* Using OOC (out-of-character) chat or disconnecting to avoid roleplay consequences.
